#  About

This dashboard is written in R, and is a sandpit for testing different visualisations. All data used here are available on the [Scottish Parliament's website](https://parliament.scot/chamber-and-committees/research-prepared-for-parliament/financial-scrutiny?qry=budget%202021). 
 
The structure and styling of this demonstration dashboard is based on the [Population Dashboard](https://scotland.shinyapps.io/population_dashboard/). See [repo here](https://github.com/DataScienceScotland/population_programme_dashboard).

All information in this site is provided "as is", with no guarantee of completeness or accuracy - due to speed and time available for building, there are definitely errors in the processing, that the data should be treated as dummy set. [You can look at the code on my personal GitHub](https://github.com/dplloyd/scottish_budget).
