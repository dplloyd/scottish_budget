#  Summary

The structure and styling of this demonstration dashboard is based on the [Population Dashboard](https://scotland.shinyapps.io/population_dashboard/). See [repo here](https://github.com/DataScienceScotland/population_programme_dashboard).

This dashboard is a sandpit for testing different visualisations. All data are 
 available at https://parliament.scot/chamber-and-committees/research-prepared-for-parliament/financial-scrutiny?qry=budget%202021.

A full app development would allow near complete control over appearance, layout, etc.

All information in this site is provided "as is", with no guarantee of completeness or accuracy - there are definitely errors in the processing, that the data should be treated as dummy set.
